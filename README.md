# Ultimate General Website Template

An opinionated full-stack SaaS template for teams that want to start from a hardened, reusable product baseline instead of rebuilding the same infrastructure on every project.

## Stack

- `apps/web`: Next.js 15 App Router, Tailwind, shared UI package, nonce-based CSP with staged report-only rollout support, strict browser security headers, and server-side `/api/*` proxying
- `apps/api`: NestJS 11, Prisma, Postgres, Swagger, session-cookie auth, CSRF protection, idempotency, RBAC, rate limiting, audit logging
- `apps/api`: enterprise identity support with OIDC-first login, optional SAML and SCIM, break-glass login, and owner step-up confirmation
- `apps/api`: Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/api/metrics` with optional OTLP tracing behind `FEATURE_OBSERVABILITY`
- `packages/contracts`: shared ts-rest contract router for website-facing API calls
- `packages/db`: shared Prisma schema, migrations, seed flow
- `packages/shared`: shared Zod contracts and DTO types
- `packages/ui`: reusable UI primitives and styling helpers
- `packages/config`: shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript config

## What Is Included

- email/password signup, login, logout, logout-all, session revocation, forgot-password, and reset-password flows
- single-tenant roles: `owner`, `admin`, and `member`
- authenticated dashboard shell with profile settings, session security, and admin user management
- Projects reference slice with indexed search, filters, cursor pagination, ownership-aware mutations, detail/edit, archive, delete, and streamed CSV export
- Docker-first local stack with Next.js, NestJS, and Postgres
- optional observability profiles for Prometheus and Grafana
- real lint, typecheck, unit tests, API integration tests, and Playwright auth/project/session/RBAC coverage
- DB-backed bootstrap ownership state and owner-floor role protection for concurrent admin changes
- markdown lint, internal doc-link validation, and k6 performance assets for auth/session/write-heavy flows
- browser-boundary hardening with CSP, clickjacking protection, strict cookie forwarding, route-level forbidden/error states, and role-aware admin navigation
- contract-backed web/API calls through `packages/contracts` with runtime Zod validation for JSON responses and explicit non-JSON handling for export/download paths
- accessible auth forms with polite live error regions and field-level associations
- CI, Docker image publishing workflow, and CodeQL scanning
- enterprise SSO, optional SCIM provisioning, retention-aware governance cleanup, Kubernetes deployment baseline, and release-integrity workflows for SBOM, dependency review, image scanning, signing, and provenance

## Quick Start

### Local development

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev:services
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

Open:

- web: `http://localhost:3000`
- API docs: `http://localhost:4000/api/docs`
- health: `http://localhost:4000/api/health`

Seeded owner credentials come from `.env`:

- email: `owner@example.com`
- password: `ChangeMe123!`

`APP_ENV` is the deployment-security axis:

- `local` for developer machines
- `test` for automated test harnesses
- `staging` and `production` for strict deploy targets

Local-only toggles such as `ALLOW_MISSING_ORIGIN_FOR_DEV` and `EXPOSE_DEV_RESET_DETAILS` now fail fast outside their allowed environments.

### Docker

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The Compose stack starts Postgres, runs migrations and seeding in the API container, then serves:

- web on `http://localhost:3000`
- API on `http://localhost:4000`

### Windows + WSL

If you run the repo from WSL, use Linux shell commands inside WSL and make sure Docker Desktop has WSL integration enabled for your distro. Typical flow:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

## Common Commands

- `npm run dev`: start web and API in watch mode
- `npm run dev:services`: start Postgres only
- `npm run db:setup`: run local migrations and seed data
- `npm run db:reset`: reset the database and reseed it
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint and Prisma validation
- `npm run typecheck`: run TypeScript and Prisma validation
- `npm test`: run workspace Vitest suites
- `npm run test:e2e`: run the full Playwright E2E suite
- `npm run test:e2e:enterprise`: run the enterprise-login Playwright smoke under the OIDC-first enterprise profile
- `npm run docs:check`: run markdown lint and internal link validation
- `npm run test:perf:smoke`: run the smoke-level k6 performance scenario
- `npm run test:perf:critical`: run the deeper critical auth/session/project API performance scenario
- `npm run perf:up`: start the Compose stack with the local perf env overlay for K6 runs
- `npm run perf:down`: stop the local perf stack
- `npm run build`: produce production builds for every workspace
- `npm run docker:up`: build and start the Compose stack
- `npm run docker:down`: stop and clean up Compose containers

## Extension Slots

The default template keeps the runtime small: web, API, and Postgres only. Optional extension services live in [`infra/compose/docker-compose.extensions.yml`](infra/compose/docker-compose.extensions.yml) and stay off by default.

- `cache`: Redis
- `email`: Mailpit
- `storage`: MinIO
- `edge`: Nginx reverse proxy

## Built From

This template was shaped against a private research archive of open-source
repositories, official documentation, and public issue discussions, not copied
from a single starter. The public provenance map of direct donors, validation
references, and intentionally unadopted patterns is in
[Reference Baseline](docs/reference-baseline.md).

## Dependency Security Notes

The repo currently vendors patched copies of `@nestjs/config` and
`@nestjs/swagger` under `vendor/` because their published manifests still pin
vulnerable transitive versions of `lodash` and `path-to-regexp`. Only package
manifests were changed; runtime code remains the upstream package build output.

See [`vendor/README.md`](vendor/README.md) for the exact patched dependencies
and remove the vendored copies once upstream publishes equivalent fixes.
