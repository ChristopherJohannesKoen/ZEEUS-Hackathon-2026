# Governance And Compliance Guide

## Target Posture

This repo is now shaped toward an audit-ready enterprise baseline aligned with the style of:

- SOC 2 controls
- ISO 27001 operational expectations

It is not a complete compliance program by itself. It provides application, deployment, and CI evidence points that a larger governance program can consume.

## Audit Trail

`AuditLog` now stores:

- event category
- outcome
- auth mechanism
- request ID
- source IP
- user agent
- legal-hold flag
- previous-entry hash
- entry hash

The `previousHash` and `entryHash` fields form a tamper-evident chain so downstream export or warehousing systems can verify continuity.

## Access Policy Events

`AccessPolicyEvent` records identity and privilege decisions that matter beyond simple CRUD audit lines:

- JIT provisioning
- SCIM provisioning
- group mapping
- break-glass login
- owner step-up completion
- provider configuration changes

## Data Retention

The governance module runs legal-hold-aware cleanup for:

- audit logs
- expired sessions
- password reset tokens
- idempotency records

Retention controls:

- `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`
- `SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS`
- `PASSWORD_RESET_RETENTION_DAYS`
- `IDEMPOTENCY_RETENTION_DAYS`

Legal hold:

- audit rows marked `legalHold=true` are excluded from automated cleanup
- this is the application hook; the operational process for setting or clearing holds belongs in your security/legal runbook

## Disabled Instead Of Deleted

Enterprise-provisioned users are disabled on deprovision rather than hard-deleted by default. This preserves:

- audit continuity
- historical ownership and project references
- incident-investigation traceability

## Secret Loading

The application no longer assumes all secrets must be inline env strings. `SecretService` supports:

- direct env values
- `${NAME}_FILE` file-backed values

This makes the template compatible with:

- Kubernetes Secrets
- External Secrets operators
- Vault sidecar/file injections
- cloud secret-manager mount patterns

Recommended rotation order:

1. provision a new versioned secret
2. update the deployment manifest or secret reference
3. roll the affected workload
4. confirm health, auth, and audit behavior
5. retire the old secret only after the new version is verified

This order applies to:

- `SESSION_COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SAML_CERTIFICATE_PEM`
- `SCIM_BEARER_TOKEN`

## Evidence Map

The repo now produces compliance-relevant evidence from:

- CI runs
  - format, lint, typecheck, tests, build, dependency review, CodeQL
- release workflows
  - SBOM generation
  - image scanning
  - provenance attestation
- runtime records
  - audit logs
  - access-policy events
  - Prometheus metrics
- deployment assets
  - Kubernetes manifests
  - explicit secret/config separation
- operational runbooks
  - deployment
  - environment catalog
  - operations guide
  - enterprise identity guide

The explicit repo-owned control mapping is documented in
[Control And Evidence Matrix](./control-evidence-matrix.md).

## Remaining Organization-Level Work

This template does not replace:

- organization-wide access reviews
- HR joiner/mover/leaver process controls
- ticketing and approval workflows
- SIEM retention policy
- formal risk register management
- legal review of retention and deletion requirements
