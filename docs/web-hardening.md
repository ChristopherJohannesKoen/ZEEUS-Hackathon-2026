# Web Hardening Guide

## Purpose

This document describes the hardened website baseline in `apps/web`. It is the reference for:

- browser security headers and Content Security Policy
- contract-backed web-to-API transport
- role-aware navigation and protected route behavior
- accessible auth-form behavior
- the expectations for future web-layer changes

The goal is not "secure enough for a demo." The goal is a repeatable default that can survive real product customization without regressing into ad hoc client behavior.

The website now also participates in the enterprise identity posture:

- provider-first login discovery
- explicit default-provider semantics from the `sso/providers` contract
- local-auth suppression when enterprise identity is enforced
- explicit break-glass affordances only through a documented operator mode
- owner step-up UX before role-sensitive admin actions

## Reference Baseline

The web hardening model in this document was informed by a private research
archive of open-source repositories, official documentation, and public issue
discussions, especially:

- `next-safe-middleware-main` and the archived Next.js CSP issue PDFs for nonce
  and App Router behavior
- `ts-rest-main`, `zod-main`, and `zodios-main` for contract-backed client
  patterns
- `react-spectrum-main` plus the NVDA and React Spectrum accessibility issue
  captures for auth-form error semantics

The fuller provenance map is documented in
[Reference Baseline](./reference-baseline.md).

## Browser Boundary

The website owns its browser security policy in [`apps/web/middleware.ts`](../apps/web/middleware.ts) and [`apps/web/lib/csp.ts`](../apps/web/lib/csp.ts).

Every non-static page response is expected to carry:

- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` with deny-by-default controls
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` in production

These headers are not delegated to a reverse proxy by default. The template sets them in-app so the security posture remains correct even in local development, preview environments, and simple deployments.

## CSP Model

### Core policy

The template uses a nonce-based CSP. The important production directives are:

- `default-src 'self'`
- `base-uri 'self'`
- `frame-ancestors 'none'`
- `form-action 'self'`
- `object-src 'none'`
- nonce-based `script-src`
- nonce-based `style-src`
- explicit `connect-src`

Production must not fall back to blanket `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`.

### Development allowances

Development keeps only the relaxations needed for local Next.js tooling:

- websocket connections for HMR
- `unsafe-eval` for development scripts
- inline styles only where framework tooling still requires them locally

Those allowances are development-only. If they leak into production, treat that as a regression.

### Report-only mode

`CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true` adds a parallel `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header. This is intended for:

- validating future CSP changes
- trialing new third-party integrations
- debugging unexpected browser violations

It is not the primary production hardening mechanism anymore. The enforced production policy is already strict by default.

### Dynamic rendering tradeoff

The root layout stays on a dynamic path so Next.js can attach the nonce per request. That is a deliberate tradeoff:

- stronger CSP
- less static optimization at the root boundary

If a future change attempts to push the root shell back toward static generation, it must preserve nonce delivery or provide an equally strong alternative.

## Transport Boundary

The website no longer treats API calls as raw path strings plus optimistic casting. JSON business endpoints are consumed through:

- [`packages/contracts`](../packages/contracts)
- [`apps/web/lib/client-api.ts`](../apps/web/lib/client-api.ts)
- [`apps/web/lib/server-api.ts`](../apps/web/lib/server-api.ts)

This means:

- method, path, params, query, and body are explicit
- success responses are validated against shared Zod schemas
- structured error responses keep `statusCode`, `message`, `code`, `errors`, and `requestId`
- malformed or unexpected JSON fails as a contract error instead of being silently cast

### Allowed transport patterns

Allowed:

- contract-backed JSON requests for business endpoints
- explicit non-JSON handling for CSV or other file downloads

Not allowed:

- generic `fetch('/api/...')` business requests in app components
- schema-optional JSON parsing
- `payload as T` style success casting

### CSRF and idempotency at the client edge

The browser client is responsible for:

- fetching `GET /api/auth/csrf` when needed
- sending `X-CSRF-Token` on authenticated unsafe requests
- attaching `Idempotency-Key` on protected create/finalize POSTs
- retrying unsafe requests only when the API returns `code: 'csrf_invalid'`

Generic `403` responses must never trigger mutation replay.

## Cookie Forwarding

The server-side web client forwards only the configured session cookie to the API.

This is a hard boundary rule:

- do not serialize and forward the full browser cookie jar
- do not let unrelated cookies become implicit auth inputs

If a new server-side API call needs additional cookie semantics, document and justify that expansion explicitly.

## Protected Route Semantics

Protected routes must distinguish:

- `401`: not authenticated -> redirect to `/login`
- `403`: authenticated but forbidden -> render forbidden state
- `404`: not found -> render not-found state
- `5xx` / upstream errors -> render error boundary

Do not collapse these into a single "logged out" or fake `404` experience. That makes debugging harder and hides real outages.

## Role-Aware UI

Route and API authorization remain the real security boundary. The website adds a second alignment layer:

- privileged navigation is filtered in the UI
- members do not see admin navigation
- owners/admins do

This reduces confusion and avoids unnecessary forbidden-route traffic, but it must never replace route or API enforcement.

Role checks should flow through capability helpers in the web layer rather than repeated string comparisons across components.

When enterprise identity is enabled:

- the default provider is shown first on `/login`, with OIDC preferred when configured
- local signup and reset routes are redirected away when policy disables them
- break-glass local login is rendered only when explicitly enabled and explicitly requested
- owner role changes require a step-up round trip from the browser

## Auth Form Accessibility

Auth forms must preserve these behaviors:

- a persistent form-level error region with `aria-live="polite"`
- field-level errors associated to controls through stable IDs
- `aria-invalid` on invalid controls
- server and validation failures announced without relying on color only
- enterprise and break-glass states must remain understandable to keyboard and screen-reader users

This applies to:

- sign in
- sign up
- forgot password
- reset password

If new auth or onboarding forms are added later, they should reuse the same error-rendering pattern rather than inventing a new one.

## Customization Rules

When changing the website:

1. Update the contract first if the change affects a JSON endpoint.
2. Keep browser security headers owned in the app unless you are replacing them with an equally well-documented deployment guarantee.
3. Treat CSP changes as security changes, not visual tweaks.
4. Keep route/API authorization intact even if the UI hides a control.
5. Preserve accessible error semantics when restyling auth flows.

## Review Checklist

Use this checklist for any substantial web-platform change:

- Does production CSP stay strict without `unsafe-inline` for styles?
- Does the change keep the root nonce path working?
- Are new JSON calls going through `packages/contracts`?
- Are new file/download endpoints explicitly non-JSON?
- Are auth-sensitive reads still uncached?
- Are `401`, `403`, `404`, and `5xx` still handled distinctly?
- If UI visibility changed, is the route/API guard still present?
- If a third-party script/style was added, were CSP docs and tests updated too?
